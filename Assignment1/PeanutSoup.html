    <h2>Required Ingredients For Peanut Soup</h2><br>

    
        <p>Serving: 6 Persons.</p>
    <ol>
        1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling<br>

1 medium carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped (1/2 cup)<br>

1 medium onion, chopped (1 1/2 cups)<br>

Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper<br>

4 cups unsalted roasted peanuts<br>

8 cups low-sodium chicken broth<br>

3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br>
Diced Granny Smith apple and red-pepper flakes, for serving<br>
    </ol>

 <h3>Instructions :</h3>
 
 <ol> 
  <h5>Step 1</h5>
 
    Heat oil in a large pot over medium. Add carrot and onion; season with salt. Cook, 
    stirring occasionally
    until vegetables are soft but have not taken on any color, about 5 minutes.
    Add peanuts, broth, and 3 cups water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, 
    uncovered, until peanuts are tender, about 1 hour, 20 minutes.
    
   <h5>Step 2</h5> 
    Working in batches (do not fill jar more than halfway), puree soup in a blender until smooth, 
    about 1 minute. 
    (Or use an immersion blender.) Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing on solids to remove as much liquid as possible. Return to pot and reheat over low, if necessary.
    
    <h5>Step 3</h5>
    Stir lemon juice into soup. Season with salt and pepper and serve, topped with apple, 
    red-pepper flakes, and a drizzle of oil.
