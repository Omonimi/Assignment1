   <h2>Preparation</h2> <br>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    
    
    Start by grinding the spices. Add them all together (ataiko, Irugege and a cup of crayfish), blend to powder. Blend the pepper as well. Wash the dried fish and remove center bones. I used dried catfish. 
    This catfish is actually my favorite, it tastes so wonderful in soups. You need just one. Pour hot water over it, wash and set aside.
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    
    Wash and precook the prawn, use half a cup of water, a seasoning cube and a pinch of salt.<br>
    
    Precook your meat, this is how – Wash properly and use two seasoning cubes and a pinch of salt. <br>
    Cook the meat until it becomes easy to chew, and the water is almost dried. Add salt to taste 
    and allow another three minutes.  <br>
    Set aside.
    </p> 
    
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    
    Boil the palm fruit for 20 minutes, pound with a mortar and pestle, transfer into a bowl, <br>
    add water and extract the juice, don’t add too much water, you want it thick. <br>
    You will need about 7-10 cups of that palm fruit juice for this soup. It should be thick.
